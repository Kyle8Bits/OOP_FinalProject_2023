### II. FORMAT DEFINITION
#### ACCOUNT'S FORMAT
> For the account format we will separate each data using comma ",". However, we decide to make some changes, so the final format will be: [ID, Username, Password, Name, Address, Phone number, Account-level, Point].     
> 
> The customers are forced to input username and password when they regis, but other information are optional. So if user want to not input any info beside username and password, it will save "null" into the text file.

#### ITEM'S FORMAT
> For the item format we will separate each data using comma ",". So the item file will have form of: [ID, Title ,Rental type, Loan type, Copy, Price, Genre].    
>    
> Since an item which has the rental type is "VIDEO_GAME" will not have its genre. For the convenience, whenever  an item is "VIDEO_GAME", its genre will be saved as "NOT_APPLICABLE".
